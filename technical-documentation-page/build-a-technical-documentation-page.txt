      <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
      <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document, structure a document into logical sections, and embed content such as images and videos into a page.</p>

      <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.</p>
      <p>In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
      <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>

      <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.</p>
      <p>The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. </p>

        HTML elements
      </header>
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
          <li>The content: This is the content of the element.</li>
          <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>

        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on</li>
          <li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ul>
